The file above was done with the help of my cousin, whom was showing me how to read documentation and use the i2C communication protocol. We ran into too many 
issues whilst trying to get a response from the slave device. I have understood the concept and put this bare bone part of th eproject to rest,
as it was taking too much time and resorted to using the wire.h library in order to communicate with the gryoscope.
