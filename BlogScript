Helloooooooo and "wElCoMe tO mY yOuTuBe cHaNnEl",


alright alright so, I started this project in 29 Jan 2022 lol, but like if you want king of procastination this was it. I had no idea 
what I was doing, and let me be real i barely actually worked on it, ijust kept saying I would.

So just one day i sat down like an NPC following a youtube drone design, spent 3 days doing it, realised I couldn't even manufacture it lol,
showed it off on my instagram then basically sacked off the design. Then I went and said lets just do the dumbest, most simplest design and bam got something printed.
Realised hwo dumb I am and that 10 mm isnt the same as 10cm pictured in my brain. So that design was nice for more photos and showing off, but was not 
practical. Now I moved on to my final design, mind you final design to actually getting this sh** to just fly off the ground lol not final in the grand scheme of
things i have planned for this drone. Designed with 2 platforms, 4 arms and the landing gear.


The programming, uft was that the biggest headache ever.
